# Homework 01 - Code Refactoring

### This week's project began with a starter code. Our goal was to refactor said code - improving its structure and accessibility, without changing its functionality.

In order to achieve that, I've made a number of changes to the Horiseon webpage.

#### HTML & CSS changes include:

- Retitling the webpage, to give it a more descriptive and useful title.
- Adjusting indentation to better convey the file's structure.
- Assigning relevantly named classes to make navigation easier.
- Adding descriptive `alt` attributes to all image tags for accessibility.
- Using combinator selectors to minimise repetition and clutter in the CSS file.
- Adjusting the order in the CSS file, so that it matches the flow of the HTML one.
- Replacing the `div` elements with semantic ones to define their content.
