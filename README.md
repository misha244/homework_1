# Homework 01 - Code Refactoring

### This week's project began with a starter code. Our goal was to refactor said code - improving its structure, without changing its functionality.

In order to achieve that, I've made a number of changes to the Horiseon webpage. These include:

- Retitling the webpage, to give it a more descriptive and useful title
- Used combinator selectors to minimise repetition in the CSS file
